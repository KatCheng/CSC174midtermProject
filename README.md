# CSC174 Midterm Project

## Information Architecture

* Ontology
Domain: "Crayon Shin-chan" the anime. I included basic introduction, history, anime introduction, and main characters descriptions in my website. 
Limits: I will not include other relavant things such as the Crayon Shin-chan manga and the Crayon Shin-chan video game. 

* Choreography
On the index page, I will use a picture of Shin-chan as the background image, to tell the users the topic of my website. There will be three buttons on the index page, namely "history and basic information", "media", and "main characters", each will lead the users to a different page with information about one of these three topics.

## Design

* Z-Pattern: This is used in the index page because it is less content-heavy. The Z-Pattern has four quadrants - primary, strong, weak, and terminal. As the name indicated, each quadrant serves contents with different levels of importance - primary: history and basic information; strong: media(anime); weak: description of the Shin-chan; terminal: main characters.

* F-Pattern: 

* C.R.A.P principles
  *Contrast:
  *Repetition:
  *Alignment:
  *Proximity
 
* Typefaces/Fonts

* CSS Architecture

## Technical Coding

* Database
  database user = "urcscon3_xcheng5"
  database passwork = "coffee1N"
  database name = "urcscon3_xcheng5"
