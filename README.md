# CSC174 Midterm Project
### Name: Xiao Cheng
Website location: http://www.urcsc174.org/midterm/xcheng5/index.php

## Information Architecture

#### Ontology
Domain: "Crayon Shin-chan" the anime. I included basic introduction, history, anime introduction, and main characters descriptions in my website. 
Limits: I will not include other relavant things such as the Crayon Shin-chan manga and the Crayon Shin-chan video game. 

#### Choreography
On the index page, I will use a picture of Shin-chan as the background image, to tell the users the topic of my website. There will be three buttons on the index page, namely "history and basic information", "media", and "main characters", each will lead the users to a different page with information about one of these three topics.

## Design

#### Z-Pattern
This is used in the index page because it is less content-heavy. The Z-Pattern has four quadrants - primary, strong, weak, and terminal. As the name indicated, each quadrant serves contents with different levels of importance - primary: history and basic information; strong: media(anime); weak: description of the Shin-chan; terminal: main characters.

#### F-Pattern: 

#### C.R.A.P principles
  * Contrast: Used different sizes of fonts to represent the levels of importance. Also made some elements bold in order to stress the importance.
  * Repetition: Used same kind of font for same kind of element (e.g. 'Dokdo' for h1, 'Gloria Hallelujah' for h2 and h3, 'kalam' for p, etc.). Used same colors for every page. Remained in the same format for sections within the same page. 
  * Alignment: Used left alignment on all pages. Used center alignment for all titles.
  * Proximity: Related information were grouped together and displayed on the same page.
 
#### Typefaces/Fonts
I actually picked more than two typefaces, all of which are from google fonts. I picked Dokdo for h1 because it is really bold and I think it really suits the title of each page. I picked Jua for the links because I want them to stand out and be more noticeable. I also picked Gloria Hallelujah and Kalam for other headings and paragraphs, respectively, because I want the users to be able to distinguish each elements. I did not use the same font bewteen the title (h1) and other headings (h2 and h3) because I do not think the bolder font is suitable within the main contents. All fonts that I pick have one most important thing in common - they all convey a cartoon-y mood, which I think really goes well with our domain (Crayon Shin-chan the anime).

#### CSS Architecture
I used normalize.css before applying my styles.css, in order to normalize the default browser settings. There are two main parts of my CSS architecture - BASE and LAYOUT. There are also more specific sections, such as z-pattern for the index page, as well as specific styles for elements like navigation bar and form.

## Technical Coding

#### Database
  * database user = "urcscon3_xcheng5"
  * database passwork = "coffee1N"
  * database name = "urcscon3_xcheng5"
  
#### Credit
I "stole" Professor Kostin's index page, because I think it works really well for the Z-Pattern requirement. However, I modified some of his CSS codes and added more CSS codes for my other pages and elements. As for my content, I picked some from Wikipedia, and included the link in the reference section on each page.
